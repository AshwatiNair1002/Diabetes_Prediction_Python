    With the initial data visualizations, relationshiops and trends were identified. From the pie chart, 65.6% of the cases in the dataset did not have diabetes while 34.4% did. The average age is 33, and the majority of the cases are aged 25 to 40. 

This dataset is imbalanced with the 65.6% not having diabetes and 34.4% having diabetes. This tells us that there is a possibility of those not having diabetes being more represented and our model will have a bias towards that majority. Since all of the data in this dataset was collected from females of Pima Indian heritage the model would not be able to be used as a reliable predictor for diabetes in a varied population of people.
    
  Overall, the occurance of diabetes amongst the population increased as glucose level, insulin level, BMI and number of pregnancies increased. This suggests that there is a positive relationship between the variables and presence of diabetes. 

    For supervised machine learning, Logistic Regression and KNN were chosen as the outcome/dependent variable was catgorical.
