This was a group project completed in 2023 for the HI 2022 course in the MSHI program at UPitt. Python was utilized for data analysis and machine learning. 
The Healthcare-Diabetes dataset from Kaggle was created to predict what factors are useful in predicting wheter a person will develop diabetes. 
The independent variables in the dataset are age, number of pregnacies, blood pressure, insulin level, blood gucose level, BMI and skin thickness. 
The dependent variable is wheher the person has diabetes or not. The hypothesis is that these factors DO contribute to an individual devloping diabetes.
